v0.3:  - Fix the PHPDoc generating.
       - Maybe allow <qb:created> and <qb:modified> to be overridden in a .qb file's header.
       - Check whether tsfix can be used to import from other blog systems when changing the metadata is not an option.
       - Fix qb not working correctly when installed directly into the document root.

v0.5:  - Put qb under the GPL.
       - Tidy up:

         - Split qb into several object-oriented modules.
       - Think of a new, future safe URL schema.
         - Modify htaccess to keep old links working.
         - Maybe allow URLs without htaccess altogether.
       - Make it possible to use different themes without editing qb.php.
       - Make tsfix.php find lone .cre files.
       - Introduce a configurable tolerance timespan to keep qb from showing
         articles as "updated" if they have been changed seconds after creation.

         - Comments.
         - Trackbacks (receiving and sending).
         - Pingbacks (receiving and sending).
         - Pings to popular blog directories.
