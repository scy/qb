v0.3:  - Put qb under the GPL.
       - Tidy up:
         + Move everything out of src/ because only articles should be there.
         + Move the (default) configuration file into lib/.
         - Split qb into several object-oriented modules.
       - Think of a new, future safe URL schema.
         - Modify htaccess to keep old links working.
       - Make it possible to use different themes without editing qb.php.
       + Store creation timestamps _in_ the .cre files as well in order to allow
         reconstruction of lost timestamps.
         - Write a contrib script to recover them.
       - Introduce a configurable tolerance timespan to keep qb from showing
         articles as "updated" if they have been changed seconds after creation.

v0.4:  - Modules galore:
         - Comments.
         - Trackbacks (receiving and sending).
         - Pingbacks (receiving and sending).
         - Pings to popular blog directories.
         - Search tracker and referrer tracker.
