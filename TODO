v0.3:  - Fix the PHPDoc generating.
       - Documentation about overriding qbURL settings.
       - Maybe allow <qb:created> and <qb:modified> to be overridden in a .qb file's header.
       - Check whether tsfix can be used to import from other blog systems when changing the metadata is not an option.
       - Fix qb not working correctly when installed directly into the document root.
       - Add <qb:ifnotset> tag.
       - Support for "static" pages (dynamically generated, but not visible on the date-ordered main page).
         Not sure if this is an item for 0.3 or rather for a later version.
       - Set up a qb mailing list.

v0.5:  - Put qb under the GPL.
       - Tidy up:
         + Move everything out of src/ because only articles should be there.
         + Move the (default) configuration file into lib/.
         - Split qb into several object-oriented modules.
       - Think of a new, future safe URL schema.
         - Modify htaccess to keep old links working.
         - Maybe allow URLs without htaccess altogether.
       - Make it possible to use different themes without editing qb.php.
       - Make tsfix.php find lone .cre files.
       - Introduce a configurable tolerance timespan to keep qb from showing
         articles as "updated" if they have been changed seconds after creation.

v0.6:  - Modules galore:
         - Comments.
         - Trackbacks (receiving and sending).
         - Pingbacks (receiving and sending).
         - Pings to popular blog directories.
         - Search tracker and referrer tracker.
         - Web interface for creating new articles.
