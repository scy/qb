qb :: quick blogging
====================

qb is a blog system for users who:
 - don't want to install a database server for blogging every two months
 - prefer performance over object-oriented plugin-based portal code
 - like to be able to send entries via SCP

The default configuration files are those of scytale.de. That means two things:
First, you'll want to change it. Second, you'll have some nice examples.

Questions please to scy-dev-qb@scytale.de or contact me via IRC, I'm Scytale
at freenode and usually hang out in #c3ma.


SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
===================

 - PHP 5
 - Apache Web Server (others not tested)
 - Unix-based OS (others not tested)

Please contact me if you managed to run qb on something "not tested".


INSTALLATION
============

Copy all files into a directory in the Document Root of your webserver. You can
use a subdirectory or the top directory. You may want to move the "htaccess"
file to ".htaccess" or create a symlink to it.

Copy qb.distcfg.php to qb.cfg.php and edit it according to your needs.

You may wish to create your own templates (find them in src/) and CSS. The
templates to use are linked in qb.cfg.php, the CSS in the template.

Make sure your web server can write to the QB_META directory.

Start putting files with your configured suffix (default: .qb) into the "src"
directory.


CONTENT FILE SYNTAX
===================

Each content file consists of a header (the first line) and a body (everything
else). The header consists of several tags formatted like "<NAME:VALUE>", where
NAME will be the name of a template variable and VALUE its value.

There are some special things: If you don't supply a NAME, it's the same as
setting it to "title", therefore you can supply the entry's title like
<:My cool entry> or <title:My cool entry>, it's equivalent.

Then there's the <tags:> tag where you can supply some tags for the entry.
Those are available in the template via "spantags" and "ultags", depending on
whether you like <span class="tag"> or <ul class="tags"><li>... more. Soon one
will be able to search for certain tags as well. Specify the tags as in Flickr,
ie. seperate them with spaces and put double quotes around multi-word tags:
<tags:example documentation boring "all your tags are belong to us" omg>

Last but not least there's the <via:> tag where you can place a link to another
blog to cite as source: <via:<<http://example.com/blog/23-foo.html ExBlog>>>
(See below for the default "link" syntax.) You can also put unlinked text in it:
<via:Fefe's Blog>. There'll probably be a trackback function soon.

You can add other tags if you want to, their values will be available in the
templates like any other ones.

The body contains HTML code plus some regex shortcuts. With the default config
you can write things like <<http://example.com/link Description>> which will
then translate to <a href="http://example.com/link">Description</a>. There's
other stuff like <wXX:Lemma_with_underscores Description> which will link to
http://XX.wikipedia.org/Lemma_with_underscores.


URL SCHEMA
==========

Suppose you've installed qb in a subdirectory called "qb" on your web server
scytale.de and you've activated the supplied .htaccess file. Now every request
that starts with http://scytale.de/qb/ will be handled by qb.
