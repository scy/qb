This is qb's svn version.

qb is a small and hacky blog system, so expect the source code to be hacky and
the documentation to be small.

The current code and configuration files are those of scytale.de. That means two
things: First, you'll want to change it. Second, you'll have some nice examples.

Questions please to scy-dev-qb@scytale.de.

I'm not quite sure whether qb will be developed further, because I'm already
planning a new system. Information about that will be available in this
repository, if there's going to be a new system.
