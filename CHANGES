CHANGES for qb :: http://scytale.de/proj/qb/

Version 0.2.2 (2007-05-06):
 - bugfix for 0.2.1: If the number of items was exactly divisible by
   QB_MAXITEMS, qb would calculate the page number as one too much, leaving you
   with an empty last page.

Version 0.2.1 (2007-05-06):
 - bugfix for 0.2: <qb:ifset> was not working like it should when nesting
   multiple ifsets that evaluated to false. This would for example seriously
   break the sample template when less than QB_MAXITEMS were in the blog. Fixed
   by using back references in two regexes now.

Version 0.2 (2007-05-06):
 - new: Split the output into multiple pages. The desired page number can be
   chosen by putting a positive integer into the "query" part of the URL ("?5").
 - commented the whole code and configuration file, but not the templates
 - removed unneeded code parts from pre-0.1

Version 0.1 (2007-03-22):
 - initial release of that what seems to work on scytale.de to the public
