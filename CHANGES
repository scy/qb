CHANGES for qb :: http://scytale.name/proj/qb/

Version 0.3.0 (2008-02-xx):
 - new: Official support for lighttpd.
 - new: Auto-detection of paths and required URL parts.
 - removed: QB_BASEURL constant; all that stuff is now configured via the qbURL
   class (if you need to configure anything at all).
 - qb-0.2.php is now using the new 0.5 classes internally, but it's still a
   long way to 0.5.
 - new: tsfix.php maintenance script fixes your timestamps.
 - new: Some more regexes in the default config.
 - new: Creation timestamps are now stored _in_ the .cre files as well.
 - Moved all kinds of files around; qb.php in the main directory is now just a
   wrapper for qb-0.2.php. It's the transition to 0.5 going on, but everything
   should work as it did before.
 - Template tags documented in the README.html.

Version 0.2.2 (2007-05-06):
 - bugfix for 0.2.1: If the number of items was exactly divisible by
   QB_MAXITEMS, qb would calculate the page number as one too much, leaving you
   with an empty last page.

Version 0.2.1 (2007-05-06):
 - bugfix for 0.2: <qb:ifset> was not working like it should when nesting
   multiple ifsets that evaluated to false. This would for example seriously
   break the sample template when less than QB_MAXITEMS were in the blog. Fixed
   by using back references in two regexes now.

Version 0.2 (2007-05-06):
 - new: Split the output into multiple pages. The desired page number can be
   chosen by putting a positive integer into the "query" part of the URL ("?5").
 - commented the whole code and configuration file, but not the templates
 - removed unneeded code parts from pre-0.1

Version 0.1 (2007-03-22):
 - initial release of that what seems to work on scytale.de to the public
